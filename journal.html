	<p>10/3 Week 1 I had a range of feelings throughout this unit's first week: enthusiasm and tension. Every week's codes have provided me with the chance to learn more about a variety of subjects and myself. When I started this course, I was interested in teaching, but now I'm also interested in learning. </p>

<p>10/10 Week 2 I am now struggling to import my journal to my website and to create the contents tab that I see others doings.To be completely honest, I got bored quickly and lost interest. </p>

<p>10/17 Week 3 I now understand more about Sublime Text much more and it makes more sense to me. I going to set up lab times that I can review and understand divs more. It was a stuggle but I'm pulling through.After my lab with Molly, I felt more confident and could code by myself well.</p>
