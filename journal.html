	<p>10/3 Week 1: I had a range of feelings throughout this unit's first week: enthusiasm and tension. Every week's codes have provided me with the chance to learn more about a variety of subjects and myself. When I started this course, I was interested in teaching, but now I'm also interested in learning. </p>

<p>10/10 Week 2: I am now struggling to import my journal to my website and to create the contents tab that I see others doings.To be completely honest, I got bored quickly and lost interest. </p>

<p>10/17 Week 3: I now understand more about Sublime Text much more and it makes more sense to me. I going to set up lab times that I can review and understand divs more. It was a stuggle but I'm pulling through.After my lab with Molly, I felt more confident and could code by myself well.</p>

<p> (Rest of October & November): This month was overall a 6/10 wasn't too exciting nor too boring. I've always had some sort of interest in comp sci and how it works.

One of the things that really stood out to me was the concept of the structure of the htmls. I often confuse why components are in the body part of the code or the style section or the head etc. However, once you master it becomes very simple and a quick process. It was amazing to think about the power and potential of algorithms and how they can be used. Sublime Text is very quick and very useful to make projects for friends and family.

Overall, the first few months in computer science was more exciting than not and I can't wait to learn more.</p>

<p> 12/8 Week Almost Winter Break: Today was easily the best class we had. In class I learned that I am not too good with children. However, it was still a very fun expirience. We went to little Dalton and learned how to navigate little drones with first graders who were very smart. Today was a sigma class and something that I will never forget.
</p>

<p>12/12 Last Week Before Break: Today in class we talked about something very scary. It was called Chat GPT. It is an AI ran software that knows everything about everything to evere exist. The scary because over time I feel like humans will loose control over the world and it will become Artificial Intelligence ran. Once the day comes that something like that occurs, it is over. On the bright side, one of Molly's friends came in and talked about his expierence working with famous basketball video game company, NBA 2k. He is a voice actor. I really enjoyed today's class, I made me feel much more awakened to society's traps</p>
